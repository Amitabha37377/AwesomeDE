<p align="center">Welcome to my stash of dotfiles of my AwesomeWM setups and config files for some other programmes I use. Note that I am a pro procrastinator and a not pro programmer, so there may be some broken code and incomplete stuff in the dotfiles. </p>

## [1. TOPBAR + DOCK](https://github.com/Amitabha37377/Awful-DOTS/tree/topbar_dock)

<p align="center"><img src="./assets/topdock.png"/></p>

<p>My favourite awesomewm setup and also my daily driver. I took some inspiration form MacOS for the design which is clearly visible for control center. Also contains some cool widgets I thought it will be nice to have.</p>

## [2. SLIDING VERTICAL BAR](https://github.com/Amitabha37377/Awful-DOTS/tree/vertical_bar)

<p align="center"><img src="./assets/verticalbar.png"/></p>

<p>A setup with sliding vertical bar. Aim was to make a featureful desktop while also minimizing the clutter in the screen as much as possible. Also has some cool animations thanks to <a href="https://github.com/andOrlando/rubato">rubato</a>. The animations may cause some lag and performance issues though.</p>

## [3. BOTTOMBAR](https://github.com/Amitabha37377/Awful-DOTS/tree/bottom-bar)

<p align="center"><img src="./assets/bottombar.png"/></p>

<p>AwesomeWM setup containing bottom bar. The design was inspired from the design of chrome os and Windows 11. This config is kinda abandoned at this point though.</p>
